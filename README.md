### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Geziel Carvalho!

I'm a full stack developer and an airspace control specialist.

As a developer, I code with Java but also with PHP.

I can mananage structured databases, such as postgres and MySQL, or non structured databases like MongoDB and others.

At the frontend I make use since vanilla javascript to ReactJS. We can of course adapt to other JS libraries as needed.
